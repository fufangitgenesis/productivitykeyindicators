# Productivity Key Indicator (PKI) v2.0 Web Application

## Master Your Time, Quantify Your Effectiveness.

The Productivity Key Indicator (PKI) is a sophisticated, privacy-first web application designed to empower users to master their time and transform "busyness" into "effectiveness." Moving beyond simple time tracking, PKI provides a quantified, data-driven framework for planning, executing, and reflecting on daily productivity.

### üí° Core Philosophy

PKI is built on four foundational pillars:

1.  **Intentional Planning**: Productivity begins with a clear plan. PKI encourages users to define their intentions and set targets for the day before they begin.
2.  **Dual-Metric Feedback**: Gain comprehensive insights with two distinct feedback loops:
    *   **Composite Score (0-100)**: A holistic, goal-oriented measure of daily success against your planned targets.
    *   **XP Score (Points-Based)**: A granular, activity-driven measure of effort that fuels long-term engagement and progression.
3.  **Gamified Progress**: Leverage proven mechanics like XP, levels, and streaks to make the journey of self-improvement engaging, motivating, and rewarding.
4.  **Absolute Data Privacy**: Your data is exclusively yours. The application is 100% client-side, runs offline, and requires no accounts or cloud sync. All data lives and dies on your device unless you choose to export it.

### üéØ Target User Persona

PKI is ideal for motivated individuals (students, professionals, creators, lifelong learners) who value data, appreciate structured systems, and are looking for a powerful tool to build lasting habits of focus and discipline.

*   **Composite Score**: A weighted calculation (0-100) based on:
    *   **Completion Rate**: Follow-through on high-priority tasks.
    *   **Focus Ratio**: Proportion of time spent in deep concentration.
    *   **Distraction Ratio**: Ability to avoid low-value activities.
    *   **Throughput**: Overall task completion volume.
    *   **Rest Balance**: Adherence to planned recovery.
*   **XP Score**: Earn points for every minute logged, contributing to your overall progression.

#### üéÆ Gamification Engine
